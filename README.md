## Motivation

I was bored and finally thought about trying ChatGPT from OpenAi and I thought it would be easier if I could just chat with ChatGPT from WhatsApp.

I looked for references for this and there are still very few open-source that specifically shows what I need, so I made this project open-source so hopefully it can be useful for those who need it.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anggara-26/Ucup-Ai.git
```

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Put your openAi API Key `OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` at `.env`
4. Put your MongoDB URI at `.env` if you use Remote Auth Strategy (optional)
5. Personalize your chat bot, change `PREFIX_TEMPLATE` variable at `src/ai.ts`
6. Run `npm run dev`
7. Scan the QRCode

## Installation

```bash
npm i
```

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Scan the QRCode on your WhatsApp app.

Done.
